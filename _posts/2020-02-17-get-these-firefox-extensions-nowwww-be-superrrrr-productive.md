As far as I know the extensions I'm going to tell you are quite less known 🤫 but extremely useful and will increase you productivity to next level.🤓

Today I decided to share my complete list of **11** Firefox extensions/addons with you guys, so that everyone can gain benefits.

Here it goes ...

## 1. Dark Reader

This forces every website to be in dark mode. It also has 5+ color schemes and custom CSS editing facility for dark mode.

You all will love it !

## 2. WhatFont

It is very handy for knowing the font used, the weight,line height etc etc about the page. Just click and hover and click and the popup with the info will show you everything you want.

## 3. ColorZilla

Best color picker till date (_\-_)

## 4. Download All Images

It is an extension and not a sentence :), that name is too long and the working is tooooo good. It's a Swiss army knife for getting all the images on the webpage in one click.
It has filers like: REGEX,Zipping etc etc. List of features is endless.

A must have for everyone.

## 5. Measure-it

It is used to measure the elements on the page. Just click on it and then draw the overlay and it will tell width and height.

## 6. Tab Auto Refresh

As the name says, refreshes the page after given time intervals

## 7. Ruler

It seriously places a big ruler on the web page for you.

## 8. Web Developer

Behold !!!!!! The father of Swiss army knife extensions is here. My blog post will go too long to explain it.

Download and explore, it has everything (I mean every thing)

## 9. Fireshot

Just a good extension to take images, print PDFs from web page. Extremely useful as it automatically scrolls the page.

## 10. Code Injector

I love it....... This extension injects custom HTML, CSS, JS to any webpage you want and it also saves that for the particular domain.

Just download it now! You will regret otherwise :)

## 11. Linkgopher

Extracts every single link from the webpage
