I've been using MacOS icons and theme in XFCE desktop environment for a long time.

Theme:

[https://www.xfce-look.org/p/1275087/](https://www.xfce-look.org/p/1275087/)

Icon:

[https://www.xfce-look.org/s/XFCE/p/1305429](https://www.xfce-look.org/s/XFCE/p/1305429)

I also use QOGIR theme for icons and theme.
